Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1.
We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times.
Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children.
How many binary trees can we make?  Return the answer modulo 10 ** 9 + 7.

Input Description:
First line contains, n the size of array.
Second line contains, n size of elements in a array.

Output Description:
Print the number of binary tree can be made.
